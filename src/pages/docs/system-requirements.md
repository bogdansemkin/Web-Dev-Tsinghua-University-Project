# What are the requirements for Plutonium?

Plutonium does not have special hardware requirements, any system capable of running the base games should be able to run Plutonium.
However Plutonium does require a fully updated Windows 8.1 as minimum while the Launcher requires a 64 bit system and a DirectX 11 compatible Graphics Card.

Our system requirements are as follows:

* A modern Windows version
  * Windows 8.1 64 bit (fully updated with [.NET 4.7.2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=863265) installed)
  * Windows 10 (recommended!) 64 bit version 1607 or later.
  * Windows 11
* A Graphics Card that supports DirectX 11.
* 500 MB of free space on C:\.

<Alert variant="warning">

Windows 7 reached End of Life on January 14th 2020 and as such is not supported by Microsoft, at Plutonium we believe in good security principles and as such also do not support Windows 7. We highly suggest upgrading to Windows 10.
