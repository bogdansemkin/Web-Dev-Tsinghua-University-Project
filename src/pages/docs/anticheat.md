# Anticheat

Plutonium has an anti-cheat that was completely custom made by our developers. While we cannot divulge information on how it works, we can confidently say that it works as we have thwarted over
[20,000 cheating attempts!](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/10225/anticheat-1-year-statistics) It will never catch everything but it most people agree that is does a better job than some others out there.

## Plutonium Cheat Policy

It is important you read and understand the following policy in regards to our anticheat system.

**Upon detection of a Cheat:**

* Automatic ban of 7 days is placed onto the account.
* When the player tries to login, they will be displayed a message which tells them they are banned and also tells them how long is left until the ban expires.
* Attempting to bypass the ban in any way will lead to further restrictions.
* Once the ban length has expired, the system will automatically remove the ban.
* If the player is caught cheating again, the system will ban the account permanently.
* We will not provide any information regarding any given ban, remember you broke our rules.


<Alert variant="danger">

The anticheat is always active even in solo play / private match.
