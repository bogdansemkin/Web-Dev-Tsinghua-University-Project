# GSC Language

GSC, also known as "game script code", is Call of Duty's scripting language that is pretty much based off C++. The syntax is exactly the same, and the language is very limited. It is only ever used when a game/map is running.

## Where do I start?

You can start by reading our [How to: GSC](/docs/modding/gsc/how-to-gsc) guide.

Fortunately, the Plutonium community has various Modding Support & Discussion categories for each game, and various Discord channels, there you can ask for help or help others, and discuss modding-related topics.
