# Loading Mods into Plutonium

## T6

### Requirements

[GSC Toolkit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j_ocjFCQsFaWqF2-PfdoJt2nF_EpNL_G/view?usp=sharing) (Required to compile your script)

---

__Example Scripts__

- [9 Perks for Zombies](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/29/all-perk-slots-unlock-script-zombies)
- [Jugg for joining players](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/112/jugger-for-new-players-joining-at-or-after-round-8-zombies)
- ["A cat has 9 lives"](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/449/mob-of-the-dead-mod-a-cat-has-9-lives)

---

### Getting Started

1\. You can write/download any GSC of your choice. If you are writing it from scratch/have the source code, note that you will need to compile it, which we will talk about later.

<Alert variant="warning">

If you are writing your own GSC, you must have an `init()` or `main()` function somewhere. This function is called the 'entry point', and it's a function the game engine is familiar with and will call.

</Alert>

2\. For this tutorial, we are going to be writing and using this GSC as a reference.

```cs
init() // entry point
{
    level thread onplayerconnect();
}

onplayerconnect()
{
    for(;;)
    {
        level waittill("connected", player);
        player thread onplayerspawned();
    }
}

onplayerspawned()
{
    self endon("disconnect");
    for(;;)
    {
        self waittill("spawned_player");
        self iprintlnbold("^2GSC from %LocalAppdata%\\Plutonium\\storage\\t6\\scripts\\mp\\test.gsc ^1(Compiled)");
    }
}
```

3\. Using the GSC Compiler (from GSC Toolkit), simply drag and drop your raw GSC script ontop of `Compiler.exe` and it should spit out a compiled version.

3a\. If you get an error, make sure your script isn't already precompiled (open it, and if it looks like gibberish, it is already compiled)

4\. Navigate to the T6 Plutonium Folder by pressing `Win+R` and pasting `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6` into it, and hitting Ok.

5\. Create a folder called `scripts`, then inside that folder, create two new folders called `mp`, and `zm`.

6\. Take your compiled script and put it in `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\mp` or `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm` depending on which mode it is for.
If your script should always be loaded no matter the game mode copy it to `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts`

7\. When launching your server or a custom game, you will know if all has gone well or not if the console prints `Custom script 'scripts/mp/yourScriptName' loaded`.

8\. Enjoy your new GSC script!

## IW5

### Getting Startedâ €

1\. Navigate to the IW5 Plutonium Folder by pressing `Win+R` and pasting `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\iw5` into it, and hitting Ok.

2\. Create a new folder here called `scripts`.

3\. Put any amount of GSC files in here, I will be using the following code as an example.

<Alert variant="warning">

If you are writing your own GSC, you must have an `init()` or `main()` function somewhere. This function is called the 'entry point', and it's a function the game engine is familiar with and will call.

</Alert>

```cs
init() // entry point
{
    level thread onplayerconnect();
}

onplayerconnect()
{
    for(;;)
    {
        level waittill("connected", player);
        player thread onplayerspawned();
    }
}

onplayerspawned()
{
    self endon("disconnect");
    for(;;)
    {
        self waittill("spawned_player");
        self iprintlnbold("^2GSC from %localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\iw5\scripts\example.gsc");
    }
}
```

4\. Verify your GSC looks like mine, and is in the correct location.

5\. Open MW3, and start a new Private Match or Dedicated Server, your GSC script should load.

### Loading Mods / Custom Zombies Maps

<!--
We support both the vanilla game folder and the Plutonium folder for mod loading.
-->

<Alert variant="danger">

Currently, loading mods from the `%localappdata%\Activision\CoDWaW\mods` folder is buggy, please move your mods to the `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4\mods` folder to avoid things like menu corruption, or GSC errors.

</Alert>

1. Navigate to the T4 Plutonium Folder by pressing `Win+R` and pasting `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4` into it, and hitting Ok.

2. Create a folder called `mods`

![img](/images/docs/modding/loading-mods/Zzpf3O5.png)

3. Place any mods in that folder.

<!--

You can place your mod in either of these places:
- `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4\mods`   **(Recommended)**
- `%localappdata%\Activision\CoDWaW\mods`    **[BUGGY ATM, MOVE YOUR MODS/MAPS FROM HERE TO THE DIRECTORY ABOVE.]**

**We suggest using the Plutonium folder where possible though, if you crash due to a mod, try moving it to the Plutonium Mods folder instead.**

-->

If you are installing a custom mod that comes in an `.exe`, run the exe, then move the mod folder from `%localappdata%\Activision\CoDWaW\mods` to `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4\mods`.

**Note:** Mods for multiplayer must have `mp_` at the front of their folder.

### Loading Custom Maps (MP)

<!--
We support both the vanilla game folder and the Plutonium folder for loading client-side custom multiplayer maps.

You can place your mod in either of these places:
- `%localappdata%\Activision\CoDWaW\usermaps`
- `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4\usermaps`   **(Recommended)**

-->

1. Navigate to the T4 Plutonium Folder by pressing `Win+R` and pasting `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4` into it, and hitting Ok.

2. Create a folder called `mods`

![img](/images/docs/modding/loading-mods/Zzpf3O5.png)

3. Place any custom maps in that folder.

Once the map is installed, you must load a mod first. If you do not have a mod to go along with your custom map, you can load a dummy mod by [opening the console](/docs/opening-console) and typing `/fs_game mods/mp_custommaps; vid_restart` followed by `/map mp_yourmapname` and it should load right up.
