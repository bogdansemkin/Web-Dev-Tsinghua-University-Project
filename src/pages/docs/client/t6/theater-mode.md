# How to use Theater Mode

<Alert variant="warning">

This currently only works for Private Matches. This is because servers have no way to transfer demos to everyone's PC. We are working on a cloud solution to this.

</Alert>

## Recording Demos

* Before starting private match, ensure `Game Recording` is turned on.
