# Controller buttons not bound - Possible Fix

First of all - follow [our controller guide](/docs/controllers) to make sure you've setup your controller properly.

If that doesn't work - Once in game, [open the console](/docs/opening-console) and then copy and paste the following:

`exec default_controller.cfg`

Then press the enter key and close the console.

Your controls should now be set for controllers instead of keyboards.
