# Loading mods on a dedicated server

## Where do I put the mod?

1. Navigate to the T4 Plutonium Folder by pressing `Win+R` and pasting `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4` into it, and hitting Ok.

2. Create a folder called `mods`

3. Place any mods in that folder.

<!--

We support both the vanilla game folder and the Plutonium folder for mod loading.

You can place your mod in either of these places:

* `%localappdata%\Activision\CoDWaW\mods`

* `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4\mods`  \*Recommended\*

## Editing your start.bat file

Next, open your server's start.bat file and edit the line that says `set mod=""` to add your mod. For example, if your mod is called `mp_mymod` that line should say: `set mod="mods/mp_mymod"`

## Loading Custom Maps (MP)

1. Navigate to the T4 Plutonium Folder by pressing `Win+R` and pasting `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4` into it, and hitting Ok.

2. Create a folder called `mods`

3. Place any custom maps in that folder.

<!--

We support both the vanilla game folder and the Plutonium folder for loading custom multiplayer maps.

You can place your mod in either of these places:

`%localappdata%\Activision\CoDWaW\usermaps`

`%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t4\usermaps`  \*Recommended\*

-->

Once the map is in the correct place, edit your server configuration to use it in your map rotation, and if you aren't already running a mod, set one in your start batch file. (Example: `set mod="mods/mp_custommaps"`)

Note: If you don't have any mods and just want to load custom MP maps, loading a blank/dummy mod like above works just fine.

## Setting up FastDL

If you want to setup FastDL (recommended) to allow players to download your mod quicker, see [Setting up FastDL](/docs/server/t4/fastdl).
